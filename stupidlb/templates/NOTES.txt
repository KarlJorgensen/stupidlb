The Stupid Load Balancer has been installed, and will assign IP
addresses to Services of type LoadBalancer from the following IP
ranges:

{{- range .Values.CIDRs }}
- {{ . }}
{{- end }}

Note that once an IP address is assigned to a load balancer service,
the IP address "sticks" - if you later change the stupidlb
configuration to different CIDRs, this will only affect load balancer
services created _after_ the change.

Enjoy.
